# CanvasPlotter (work in prgogress) #
CanvasPlot is a very simple plotter designed for straightforward plotting using HTML Canvas and nothing more. This project is currently in progress, aimed at providing developers with a lightweight and dependency-free solution for creating simple charts and graphs (for example for your offline IOT-device). The goal is to offer an intuitive plotting experience that respects user privacy, works offline, and requires no external dependencies.

## Features ##

- Dependency-Free: CanvasPlot is committed to simplicity. It doesn't rely on external libraries, ensuring a streamlined and efficient plotting experience.

- Offline Functionality: Embrace the flexibility of working offline. CanvasPlot enables developers to craft engaging visualizations without the need for a constant internet connection, catering to projects in various environments.

- Privacy-First: User privacy is a top priority. CanvasPlot refrains from tracking any user data, providing a secure and anonymous plotting environment for both developers and end-users.
